/**
 * useTransactions (FINLYNQ-111 Phase 2; SWR adoption FINLYNQ-115).
 *
 * Owns the main list state (`txns` / `total` / `loading` / `page`) + `loadTxns`.
 * The PUBLIC SIGNATURE is unchanged from the FINLYNQ-111 extraction —
 * `{ txns, total, loading, limit, loadTxns }` — so the consuming page is
 * untouched. The INTERNALS now run on `useSWR`:
 *
 *   - Cache key = the request URL string, built by the pure, unit-tested
 *     `buildTransactionQuery(...)` (same `{data,total}` shape, issue #59). The
 *     key changes exactly when the effective request changes — which is exactly
 *     when the pre-115 `loadTxns` `useCallback` was re-created and re-fired.
 *   - `loadTxns()` is a bound `mutate()` (imperative "refetch now") — same call
 *     sites in the page (after create / edit / delete / dialog save).
 *   - `swrListOptions` keeps the request pattern no noisier than before
 *     (no focus/reconnect revalidation; dedup; background revalidate on
 *     nav-back; keepPreviousData so paging/filtering doesn't blank the table).
