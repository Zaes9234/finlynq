/**
 * User-DEK-encrypted column registry (2026-06-01).
 *
 * Single source of truth for "which free-text columns are user-DEK encrypted
 * envelopes". Drives:
 *   - the login sweep (`upgradeUserFieldEncryption`, Phase 5) which re-encrypts
 *     any remaining plaintext (legacy / stdio / email-import rows), and
 *   - the audit invariant (Phase 6) that guards against new plaintext writers.
 *
 * Scope is the `note`/`notes`/`payee` free-text columns plus the transaction +
 * split columns that were already encrypted before this plan. Transaction
 * RULES are NOT in this list — their sensitive fields live inside JSONB and are
 * handled by `src/lib/rules/crypto.ts` + a dedicated sweep branch.
 *
 * Stream D display-`name` columns are intentionally NOT here: post-Phase-4
 * there is no plaintext name column left to sweep (they were physically
 * dropped), and they carry a `name_lookup` HMAC sibling that the generic
 * envelope sweep would not maintain.
 *
 * Most registered tables have a direct `user_id` column and the sweep filters
 * `WHERE user_id = $1`. A table WITHOUT a `user_id` of its own (only
 * `transaction_splits` today — owned via `transaction_id → transactions`) MUST
 * declare a `userScope` override (see {@link UserScopeViaParent}) or the sweep
 * raises SQLSTATE 42703 and silently skips the whole table. The
 * `tests/upgrade-user-fields.test.ts` registry/schema consistency test guards
 * this.
 *
 * See plan/encryption-plaintext-gaps.md.
